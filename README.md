(Any info/todos about this repository can go here)
FYI: Ive descided to keep the red accent colour I think.
- change slider photos to new uploads: Blue Large and Blue Small (hopefully this one will work for an iPad)
-  change 'I'm Melanie' to white colour"
- remove sections:
  - Services (it looks like when you click on this in the nav bar it just takes you down to this section ont the home page which is cool and means I dont have to develop new pages!)
  - Pricing
  - FAQ
- add Mel-About-Me  photo to the 'A Little About Me' section
